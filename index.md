# Michelle Sun

**Building infrastructure and frameworks for confident AI deployment. Former operator turned technical founder.**

## Now

I'm building **ConceptOps**, a framework for evaluating embodied AI systems under deployment conditions—not benchmark conditions. The goal is to surface the failure modes that emerge after models pass their tests but before they're safe to ship.

I'm also developing deployment confidence tooling for robotics companies approaching production, focusing on the systematic ways AI systems fail when assumptions break, context shifts, or edge cases compound.

## Selected Work

**Deployment Risk Assessment (MCP Server)**  
An analyzer that maps failure modes across robot types and environments by searching domain literature. Built to help teams identify blind spots before deploying: what happens when your warehouse AMR encounters unexpected obstacles, or your manipulation system faces distribution drift it wasn't tested for.

**ConceptOps**  
Infrastructure for temporal abstraction and trajectory evaluation in robotics. Designed to stress-test embodied systems against real deployment scenarios rather than static benchmarks. The thesis: most AI failures happen in the gap between "works in testing" and "works in production."

**Ego2Robot**  
Transformed egocentric human video into robot-consumable training episodes. Built the full pipeline: video preprocessing, action segmentation, and dataset generation for embodied learning systems.

**IVF Outcome Predictor**  
Neural network trained on synthetic patient data to model probabilistic outcomes with uncertainty quantification. End-to-end build: data generation, architecture design, training, and evaluation.

**Vibejam**  
Built a personalized chatbot from scratch to understand modern architectures at the implementation level. Implemented transformer decoder (nanoGPT-style), Mixture-of-Experts, and post-transformer experiments.

## Writing

I write research-driven essays on embodied AI, world models, temporal abstraction, and why systems fail after passing tests.

Topics include:
- Production failure gaps in AI deployment
- Systematic failure modes in robotics and agents
- Temporal abstraction and conceptual reasoning
- Evaluation frameworks that map to real-world risk

## Background

I spent a decade building and scaling First Code Academy (edtech, teaching kids to code) from zero to ~$3M ARR. Bootstrapped, then angel-funded. Led all functions: product, growth, operations, hiring, and systems design for distributed teams of 200+.

Before that: Goldman Sachs TMT analyst with private equity screening experience.

I've advised MIT CSAIL on App Inventor commercialization and worked briefly in crypto infrastructure (Solana ecosystem) before returning to AI.

I'm based in San Francisco. I have a toddler and another on the way.
